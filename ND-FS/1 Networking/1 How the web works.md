### üíª Client vs Server

- **Client:** Your **mobile** or **laptop browser** ‚Äî devices that send requests.  
- **Server:** Any computer that **processes requests** and **responds with data**.  
  A server is essentially someone else‚Äôs computer, designed to handle multiple connections efficiently.

**Why your laptop can‚Äôt act as a full server:**
- Limited **RAM**, **storage**, and **processing power**  
- Can‚Äôt be available **24√ó7** reliably  
- Hence, we use **high-end servers** that stay online continuously

### üåç DNS (Domain Name System)

Think of DNS like a **phonebook** for the internet.

> If you want to order Domino‚Äôs Pizza, you need a **pincode**.  
> Similarly, if two devices want to communicate, they need something called an **IP address**.  
> But humans remember **names** (like `google.com`) better than numbers ‚Äî that‚Äôs why DNS exists.

When you type **google.com**, your system first needs to find its **IP address**.  
This IP is stored and managed on **DNS servers**.  
Once the IP is resolved, your browser sends the actual request to that server.

### üì∂ Modem

A **modem** converts **telephone signals** into **internet signals** ‚Äî  
transforming **digital** signals (your data) into **analog** ones and vice versa.  
It acts as the crucial **bridge** between your home and the wider network.

The entire world is connected through **high-speed fiber optic cables**,  
many of which are **laid under the sea** to link continents together.

## üß≠ Step-by-Step: What Happens When You Visit a Website

Let‚Äôs say you type `https://example.com` in your browser.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Browser Cache

**Purpose:** Stores previously visited website data ‚Äî HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.  
Also stores: DNS cache (sometimes).  

- ‚úÖ If cached ‚Üí Browser already knows the IP of `example.com` (no DNS request).  
- ‚ùå If not cached ‚Üí Browser asks the **Operating System (OS)** for DNS resolution.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ OS (Operating System) Cache

**Purpose:** OS maintains a **DNS resolver cache**,  
which maps domains to IPs (e.g., `example.com ‚Üí 93.184.216.34`).

- ‚úÖ If found ‚Üí OS returns the IP to the browser.  
- ‚ùå If not ‚Üí OS queries the **router** or the **configured DNS server**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Router

**Purpose:** Acts as a **gateway** between your computer and the internet.  
Routers may also have a **DNS cache**.

- ‚úÖ If the router knows the IP ‚Üí returns it immediately.  
- ‚ùå If not ‚Üí forwards the request to your **ISP‚Äôs DNS server**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ISP (Internet Service Provider)

**Purpose:** Provides your internet connection and often handles DNS resolution.

- ‚úÖ If cached ‚Üí ISP returns the IP from its DNS cache.  
- ‚ùå If not ‚Üí It queries the **authoritative DNS servers** on the internet.

---

### ‚ö° After DNS Resolution

Once the **browser has the IP address:**

1. Opens a **TCP** (or **TLS**, for HTTPS) connection to that IP.  
2. Sends an **HTTP request** (e.g., `GET /index.html`).  
3. The **web server** processes it and sends a **response**.  
4. The **browser** receives the response and may **cache** it for faster future loads.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Notes

- üåê **Browser Parallel Requests:**  
  A browser can request a maximum of **6‚Äì8 parallel connections** per domain.  
  Any additional requests are placed in a **queue** until earlier ones complete.

- üîó **Peering Concept:**  
  Companies like **Google**, **Netflix**, and **YouTube** establish **direct or near-direct connections** with ISPs.  
  This reduces latency and improves streaming and loading speeds for end users.

- üèõÔ∏è **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers):**  
  The global authority responsible for **managing IP address allocation** and **domain naming guidelines**.

- üîç **WHOIS:**  
  A public database that shows **who owns a domain** ‚Äî including **registration details** and **privacy protection info**.

How Web page Renders (Top most interview question)

First: What Happens When a Page Loads

When you open a page (say index.html), the browser follows a pipeline:

Mental modal (not actually)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading ‚Üí Download the HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Scripting ‚Üí Run JavaScript.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Rendering ‚Üí Build the layout (where everything goes).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Painting ‚Üí Actually draw pixels on the screen.

# Browser Rendering Process Documentation

## Overview

Understanding how browsers render web pages is crucial for web developers. This document explains the complete rendering pipeline from HTML parsing to painting pixels on screen.

---

## Key Concepts

### Critical Loading Behavior

- **CSS Loading**: Until CSS is completely loaded, the web page may appear blank or unstyled (FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Content).
- **JavaScript Execution**: When JS is executing, it blocks the HTML parser, preventing further parsing until execution completes.

### Core Definitions

- **Parsing**: The process of understanding and analyzing code structure.
- **Rendering**: The process of drawing/displaying content on screen.

---

## The Three Main Parsers

### 1. HTML Parser

Converts HTML markup into the Document Object Model (DOM).
```HTML: <h1>Hello</h1>```

### 2. CSS Parser

Converts CSS rules into the CSS Object Model (CSSOM).

```
CSS: h1 { color: "red" }
‚Üì
CSSOM: { h1: { color: 'red' } }
```

### 3. JavaScript Parser

Reads JavaScript code and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for execution.

**Visual Reference:**

## Browser Rendering Pipeline

### Step 1: Fetch HTML

The browser requests and downloads the HTML document from the server.

### Step 2: Parse HTML

The HTML parser begins reading the document and encounters references to CSS and JS files.

#### CSS Handling

CSS does **not** block HTML parsing, regardless of how it's included:
- ‚úÖ Inline CSS
- ‚úÖ Same-file CSS
- ‚úÖ External CSS files

#### JavaScript Handling

JavaScript behavior varies based on how it's loaded:

| Script Type | Download | HTML Parsing | Execution |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| `<script>` | Blocks parsing | ‚ùå Stopped | Executes immediately after download |
| `<script async>` | ‚ö° Parallel download | ‚úÖ Continues | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pauses briefly when download completes to execute |
| `<script defer>` | ‚ö° Parallel download | ‚úÖ Continues | ‚è≥ Waits until HTML parsing is complete |


---

### Step 3: Build the DOM Tree

Once HTML is parsed and JavaScript is executed, the DOM tree is formed representing the document structure.

### Step 4: CSS Parsing

The browser parses all CSS from multiple sources:
- Inline styles
- Internal `<style>` tags
- External stylesheets

**CSSOM (CSS Object Model)** is created as a structured representation containing:
- Selectors
- Properties and values
- Media queries
- Inheritance rules

### Step 5: Construct the Render Tree

```Render Tree = DOM + CSSOM```

**Important characteristics:**
- Only includes **visible elements** (excludes `display: none`, `<script>`, `<meta>`, etc.)
- Each node contains both content and computed styles
- Used by the browser to calculate layout

### Step 6: Layout (Reflow)

The browser calculates the exact position and size of each element:
- **Position**: Where the element should appear (x, y coordinates)
- **Dimensions**: Width and height
- **Box model**: Margins, padding, borders

**Example:**
```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
```
The browser determines this `<h1>` element's exact pixel position and dimensions.

### Step 7: Painting
The browser paints pixels on the screen based on the render tree:

- **Colors:** Background and foreground colors  
- **Text:** Font rendering and text effects  
- **Shadows:** Text and box shadows  
- **Images:** Raster and vector graphics  

### Step 8: Compositing
The browser manages layers and determines rendering order:

- Which layers should be visible  
- Which layers should be hidden  
- Stacking context and z-index ordering  
- Hardware-accelerated layers (GPU compositing)
