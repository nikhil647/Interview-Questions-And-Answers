# XSS Attack Diagram

Below is a simple diagram (Mermaid + ASCII fallback) that explains the basic flow of a client-side XSS attack.

---

## Mermaid diagram (use on GitHub / Mermaid-enabled viewers)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Attacker["üë®‚Äçüíª Attacker"]
  Website["üåê Vulnerable Website"]
  Victim["üßë‚Äçü¶± Victim User"]

  Attacker -->|1Ô∏è‚É£ Injects malicious script| Website
  Victim -->|2Ô∏è‚É£ Visits the infected page<br>Script runs in browser| Website
  Website -->|3Ô∏è‚É£ Sends stolen cookies / credentials| Attacker
```

## ASCII fallback (works in any Markdown viewer)

```
+----------+            1) Injects malicious script          +-----------+
| Attacker | -----------------------------------------------> | Website   |
+----------+                                                  +-----------+
                                                                  ^
                                                                  |
                                                                  | 2) Victim visits; script runs in victim's browser
                                                                  |
                                                           +-------------+
                                                           | Victim User |
                                                           +-------------+
                                                                  |
                                                                  | 3) Script steals cookies/credentials and sends to attacker
                                                                  v
+----------+ <--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attacker |                                                                |
+----------+                                                                |
                                                                            |

## How to use

* If your viewer supports Mermaid, the Mermaid block will render a clean diagram.
* If not, the ASCII fallback shows the same flow and can be copied as plain text.

## Raw Markdown (copy the whole file)

If you want a single copyable chunk, copy everything in this file. It already *is* a ready-to-save `.md` file.

---

*If you want modifications (labels, colors, or additional steps like "Payload delivered via comment field" or "Stored vs Reflected XSS"), tell me what to change and I will update the file.*
