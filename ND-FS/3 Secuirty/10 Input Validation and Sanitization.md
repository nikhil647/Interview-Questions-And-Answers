## ðŸ§© **Secure Coding & Validation Best Practices**

### 1. **Use Framework / Library**

* Use well-tested frameworks and libraries for handling security features.
* They come with built-in protection against common attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).

---

### 2. **Whitelist Validation**

* Only accept **expected** input (e.g., alphabets for names, digits for age).
* Example: Name should only allow `[A-Za-z ]`, not symbols or numbers.
* Avoid blacklist approach (itâ€™s easier to miss edge cases).

---

### 3. **Regular Expression Validation**

* Use regex to validate data format â€” emails, phone numbers, usernames, etc.
* Prevent malformed or malicious input patterns.

---

### 4. **Escape User Input**

* Always escape special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` before rendering in HTML.
* Prevents **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

---

### 5. **Parameterized URLs / Queries**

* Always use **parameterized queries** (e.g., in SQL, MongoDB, etc.).
* Prevents **SQL Injection** by separating code from data.

---

### 6. **Validate Data Types**

* Ensure input matches expected type (integer, string, boolean, etc.).
* Avoid implicit type conversion that may cause vulnerabilities.

---

### 7. **Length & Size Checks**

* Restrict max length for inputs (e.g., username â‰¤ 30 chars).
* Validate file upload sizes to prevent **DoS** or **storage abuse**.

---

### 8. **Image & File Upload Validation**

* Allow only approved file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).
* Scan uploaded files for malware.
* Never execute uploaded files on the server.

---

### 9. **Client-Side + Server-Side Validation**

* Client-side validation: improves UX and reduces load.
* Server-side validation: mandatory for security (client can be bypassed).

---

### 10. **Error Handling (Global Exception)**

* Use global exception handlers.
* Do not expose stack traces or internal system info to users.
* Log errors securely for debugging.

---

### 11. **Security Headers**

* Add headers like:

  * `Content-Security-Policy`
  * `X-Frame-Options`
  * `X-Content-Type-Options`
  * `Strict-Transport-Security`
* Protects against XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, etc.

---

### 12. **Regular Updates & Patches**

* Keep frameworks, libraries, and servers updated.
* Apply patches quickly â€” outdated components are a common attack vector.

---

### 13. **Security Audits & Testing**

* Conduct periodic **penetration tests** and **code reviews**.
* Use automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).

---

### 14. **Avoid Untrusted Third-Party Libraries**

* Use dependencies only from trusted sources.
* Check for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit`, `OWASP Dependency Check`).
