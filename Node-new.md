# 🧠 100 Node.js Interview Questions - Complete Answers

## 🟢 Node.js Basics

### 1. What is Node.js and why is it used?
**Answer:** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows executing JavaScript code outside browsers, primarily for server-side development. It's used because it offers asynchronous, non-blocking I/O ideal for handling concurrent connections efficiently, enables full-stack JavaScript development, has a vast NPM ecosystem, and excels at building scalable, real-time applications like APIs, microservices, chat apps, and streaming services.

---

### 2. How does Node.js handle child threads?
**Answer:** Node.js runs JavaScript on a single main thread, but it can use child threads behind the scenes for concurrency. It does this in two ways — first, through the libuv thread pool, which handles background I/O tasks like file operations or crypto without blocking the main event loop. And second, through the Worker Threads module, which lets developers run CPU-intensive JavaScript code in parallel.

This approach keeps Node.js non-blocking and efficient, even when handling heavy operations.

libuv Thread Pool — used automatically
	•	The Node.js runtime itself decides to use the thread pool for specific built-in APIs that are I/O or native blocking.
  ```
fs.readFile('file.txt');     // file system → thread pool
crypto.pbkdf2(...);          // crypto → thread pool
dns.lookup(...);             // DNS → thread pool
  ```
  2. Worker Threads — you choose manually

⁠Node will never use Worker Threads automatically.
	•	These are for your own CPU-heavy JavaScript logic (like loops, data processing, ML, etc.).

```
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./heavyComputation.js');
```

---

### 3. Describe the event-driven programming in Node.js.
**Answer:** Node.js means the execution of certain parts of the program is triggered by events instead of a fixed sequence of instructions.
Node.js uses the EventEmitter class, where you can emit (trigger) and listen to events.

When an event happens, Node.js calls the function (listener) attached to it — without blocking the main thread.
This is how Node.js efficiently handles asynchronous tasks like HTTP requests, file reads, or database queries.
```
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener (runs when event occurs)
emitter.on('greet', () => {
  console.log('Hello from Node.js!');
});

// Emit (trigger) the event
emitter.emit('greet');
```

---

### 4. What is the event loop in Node.js?
**Answer:** The event loop is Node.js's mechanism for managing asynchronous operations. It continuously monitors the call stack and task queues (microtask and callback/macrotask queues). The loop has phases: timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll (retrieves I/O events), check (setImmediate), and close callbacks. It executes tasks in order, with microtasks (process.nextTick, Promises) having priority over macrotasks (setTimeout, setImmediate, I/O operations).

---

### 5. What is the difference between Node.js and traditional web server technologies?
**Answer:** Node.js uses single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O while traditional servers use multi-threading with blocking I/O. Traditional servers spawn threads per request (resource-intensive when idle), while Node.js handles multiple connections on one thread. Node.js uses JavaScript for both client and server (unified development), requires no recompilation (write-save-run), and uses npm for centralized package management. Traditional servers often need separate languages and compilation. Node.js excels at real-time, data-intensive apps; traditional servers suit enterprise systems and heavy computation.

---

### 6. Explain what "non-blocking" means in Node.js.
**Answer:** Non-blocking means the application doesn't halt waiting for operations to complete. Instead of pausing execution during I/O operations (file reads, database queries), Node.js continues processing other tasks. When the operation finishes, a callback/promise is triggered. This is achieved through the event loop and asynchronous functions, enabling high concurrency without traditional threading complexity. It makes Node.js highly efficient for handling multiple simultaneous operations.

---

### 7. How do you update Node.js to the latest version?
**Answer:** Multiple methods exist: Using package managers (npm: `npm cache clean -f`, then `npm install -g n`, then `n stable`; yarn: `yarn global add n`), version managers (nvm: `nvm install node` and `nvm use node`; n: `n latest`), official installer from nodejs.org, or platform-specific tools (Windows Scoop: `scoop update nodejs-lts`). After updating, verify with `node -v`. Version managers are recommended for managing multiple versions.

---

### 8. What is "npm" and what is it used for?
**Answer:** npm (Node Package Manager) is Node.js's default package manager for installing, managing, and sharing JavaScript libraries and tools. It provides a CLI for local package management and a central registry (npmjs.com) hosting millions of packages. Key functions include dependency installation/management, version control with semantic versioning and lock files, running lifecycle scripts (start, test, build), and publishing packages. It simplifies development workflow with commands like `npm install`, `npm init`, `npm start`, and `npm publish`.

---

### 9. How do you manage packages in a Node.js project?
**Answer:** Use npm or yarn for package management. Key commands: `npm init` initializes package.json; `npm install <package>` installs dependencies; `npm install <package> --save-dev` for dev dependencies; `npm update` updates packages; `npm uninstall <package>` removes packages. package.json tracks all dependencies with versions. package-lock.json (npm) or yarn.lock ensures consistent installations. Use `npm audit` for security checks. Scripts in package.json automate tasks with `npm run <script-name>`.

---

### 10. What is a package.json file?
**Answer:** package.json is the manifest file for Node.js projects containing metadata (name, version, description, author), dependencies (production, development, optional, peer), scripts for task automation, repository information, and configuration. It's essential for npm/yarn to manage packages, ensures reproducible builds, defines entry points (main field), specifies Node version requirements (engines), and controls package visibility (private field). Created with `npm init` or `yarn init`, it's the project's central configuration file.

---

## ⚙️ Node.js Core Modules

### 11. Describe some of the core modules of Node.js.
**Answer:** Core modules include: **fs** (file system operations), **http/https** (web server/client), **path** (file path manipulation), **os** (system information), **util** (debugging utilities), **stream** (data stream processing), **events** (EventEmitter for event handling), **crypto** (cryptographic operations), **net** (TCP networking), **dgram** (UDP sockets), **url** (URL parsing), **querystring** (URL query manipulation), **zlib** (compression), **child_process** (spawning processes). These provide essential functionality without external dependencies.

---

### 12. How do you create a simple server in Node.js using the HTTP module?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```
Import http module, use `createServer()` with callback handling request/response, set status and headers with `writeHead()`, send response with `end()`, and start listening on a port with `listen()`.

---

### 13. Explain the purpose of the File System (fs) module.
**Answer:** The fs module provides APIs for file system operations including reading/writing files, creating/deleting directories, checking file stats, watching file changes, and managing permissions. It offers both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Async methods (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile) are non-blocking and preferred for servers. Sync methods (fs.readFileSync) block execution, suitable for initialization scripts. The module supports streams for efficient handling of large files and provides promises-based API (fs.promises) for modern async/await patterns.

---

### 14. What is the Buffer class in Node.js?
**Answer:** Buffer is a core class for handling binary data directly in memory. It represents fixed-size, raw binary data sequences (byte arrays). Buffers are used for I/O operations (file reading, network communication), handling binary protocols, cryptography, and data encoding/decoding between formats (UTF-8, base64, hex). Created with `Buffer.from()`, `Buffer.alloc()`, or `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`. Unlike strings, buffers have fixed size, work with raw bytes, and provide shared memory capabilities between Node.js and C++ addons for performance.

---

### 15. What are streams in Node.js and what types are available?
**Answer:** Streams handle I/O data efficiently in chunks rather than loading everything into memory. Four types: **Readable** (read data, e.g., fs.createReadStream), **Writable** (write data, e.g., fs.createWriteStream), **Duplex** (both read/write, e.g., TCP sockets), and **Transform** (modify data while reading/writing, e.g., zlib.createGzip). Streams are event-based, support piping (`stream.pipe()`), enable efficient memory usage for large files, and are foundational for HTTP requests/responses, file operations, and real-time data processing.

---

### 16. How do you read and write files in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
// Async read
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Async write
fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'content', err => {
  if (err) throw err;
});

// Using promises
const fsPromises = require('fs').promises;
async function readWrite() {
  const data = await fsPromises.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
  await fsPromises.writeFile('output.txt', data);
}

// Stream for large files
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('large.txt');
readStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt'));
```

---

### 17. How do you use the EventEmitter in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register listener
emitter.on('event', (data) => {
  console.log('Event triggered:', data);
});

// Emit event
emitter.emit('event', 'some data');

// Once listener (fires only once)
emitter.once('login', () => console.log('User logged in'));

// Remove listener
const callback = () => {};
emitter.on('event', callback);
emitter.off('event', callback);
```
EventEmitter is the base class for event handling, used extensively in Node.js for HTTP servers, streams, and custom events.

---

### 18. What is the QueryString module?
**Answer:** The querystring module (legacy, replaced by URLSearchParams) parses and formats URL query strings. Methods include `querystring.parse()` (converts query string to object), `querystring.stringify()` (converts object to query string), `querystring.escape()`, and `querystring.unescape()`. Modern approach uses `new URLSearchParams(queryString)` for parsing and manipulation. Used in HTTP request handling to extract and work with URL parameters.

---

### 19. How do you manage path operations in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const path = require('path');

path.join('/user', 'docs', 'file.txt'); // Cross-platform path
path.resolve('file.txt'); // Absolute path
path.basename('/user/file.txt'); // 'file.txt'
path.dirname('/user/file.txt'); // '/user'
path.extname('file.txt'); // '.txt'
path.parse('/user/file.txt'); // Object with path components
__dirname; // Current directory
__filename; // Current file path
```
The path module handles cross-platform file path operations, ensuring compatibility between Windows, Linux, and macOS.

---

## 🔄 Asynchronous Programming

### 20. What are callbacks in Node.js?
**Answer:** Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after an operation completes. They're fundamental to Node.js's asynchronous nature. Follow error-first callback pattern: first parameter is error (null if none), subsequent parameters are results. Example: `fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {})`. While powerful, nested callbacks create "callback hell". Modern alternatives include Promises and async/await for cleaner asynchronous code.

---

### 21. What is callback hell and how can it be avoided?
**Answer:** Callback hell is deeply nested callbacks creating pyramid-shaped, hard-to-maintain code. Solutions: 1) **Modularize** - break into named functions, 2) **Promises** - chain with `.then()`, 3) **Async/Await** - write asynchronous code synchronously, 4) **Control flow libraries** (async.js), 5) **Error handling** at each level. Example transformation:
```javascript
// Callback hell
getData(a => getMore(a, b => getMore(b, c => {})));

// Async/await
const a = await getData();
const b = await getMore(a);
const c = await getMore(b);
```

---

### 22. Explain promises in Node.js.
**Answer:** Promises represent eventual completion/failure of asynchronous operations. States: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Created with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})`. Methods: `.then()` for success, `.catch()` for errors, `.finally()` for cleanup. Can be chained for sequential operations or used with `Promise.all()` for parallel execution, `Promise.race()` for first completion, `Promise.allSettled()` for all results. Promises provide cleaner error handling and better flow control than callbacks.

---

### 23. How do async/await functions work in Node.js?
**Answer:** async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous. `async` keyword before function returns a Promise automatically. `await` pauses execution until Promise resolves, only usable inside async functions. Enables try/catch for error handling. Benefits: readable code, easier debugging, cleaner error handling. Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await fetch('api/data');
    const data = await result.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

---

### 24. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods in the fs module?
**Answer:** **Synchronous** methods (ending in 'Sync') block execution until operation completes, returning results directly. Simpler but stop event loop, reducing performance. **Asynchronous** methods use callbacks/promises, don't block execution, allow concurrent operations. Async preferred for servers handling multiple requests. Example: `fs.readFileSync()` blocks vs `fs.readFile()` or `fsPromises.readFile()` which are non-blocking. Sync acceptable for initialization scripts or CLI tools where sequential execution is desired.

---

## 🌐 Networking in Node.js

### 25. How does Node.js handle HTTP requests and responses?
**Answer:** Node.js uses the http/https modules. Server created with `http.createServer((req, res) => {})`. Request object (req) contains method, URL, headers, body (streamed). Response object (res) has methods like `writeHead()` (status/headers), `write()` (send data), `end()` (finish response). Node.js handles requests asynchronously on single thread via event loop, making it efficient for high-concurrency scenarios. Frameworks like Express abstract these for easier routing and middleware handling.

---

### 26. What is Express.js and why is it important for Node.js?
**Answer:** Express.js is a minimal, flexible Node.js web framework providing robust features for web and mobile applications. Importance: simplifies HTTP server creation, provides powerful routing system, supports middleware for request processing, template engines for views, error handling mechanisms, static file serving, and extensive ecosystem of plugins. It abstracts raw Node.js http module complexity, enabling rapid API and web app development with clean, maintainable code structure. De facto standard for Node.js web development.

---

### 27. How do you create a RESTful API with Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// GET
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

// POST
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  users.push(user);
  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// PUT
app.put('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Update logic
});

// DELETE
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Delete logic
});

app.listen(3000);
```
Use Express, define routes with HTTP verbs, handle JSON, implement proper status codes, add validation, error handling, and authentication.

---

### 28. What is middleware in the context of Node.js?
**Answer:** Middleware are functions that execute during request-response cycle, having access to req, res objects and next() function. Types: **Application-level** (app.use), **Router-level** (router.use), **Error-handling** (4 parameters), **Built-in** (express.json, express.static), **Third-party** (cors, helmet). Middleware can modify req/res, end cycle, or call next() to pass control. Used for authentication, logging, parsing, validation, CORS, error handling. Execute in order of declaration, creating processing pipeline.

---

### 29. How do you ensure security in HTTP headers with Node.js?
**Answer:** Use helmet.js middleware to set security headers: Content-Security-Policy (XSS protection), X-Frame-Options (clickjacking prevention), Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing prevention). Implement CORS properly with cors middleware, set secure cookies (httpOnly, secure flags), remove X-Powered-By header, validate input, sanitize output, use HTTPS, implement rate limiting, add authentication tokens in Authorization header, and regularly audit dependencies with `npm audit`.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Debugging

### 30. How do you handle errors in Node.js?
**Answer:** Multiple approaches: 1) **try/catch** for synchronous and async/await code, 2) **Error-first callbacks** - first parameter is error, 3) **Promise .catch()** for promise chains, 4) **Event emitters** - listen to 'error' events, 5) **Process level** - `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')`, 6) **Middleware** error handlers in Express (4 parameters), 7) **Custom Error classes** for specific error types. Always handle errors appropriately, log them, and send user-friendly responses.

---

### 31. Describe some error first callback patterns in Node.js.
**Answer:** Error-first callback (Node.js convention): first parameter is error object (null if success), subsequent parameters are results. Pattern:
```javascript
function asyncOperation(param, callback) {
  if (error) {
    return callback(new Error('Error message'));
  }
  callback(null, result);
}

asyncOperation(data, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    // Handle error
    return;
  }
  // Use result
});
```
Benefits: consistent error handling, clear separation of error/success paths, enables proper error propagation up the call stack.

---

### 32. What are some common debugging techniques for Node.js applications?
**Answer:** Techniques: 1) **console.log/debug** - basic output, 2) **Node.js debugger** - `node inspect app.js` or `node --inspect`, 3) **Chrome DevTools** - connect to --inspect, 4) **VS Code debugger** - built-in debugging, 5) **Debug module** - conditional logging, 6) **Logging libraries** (Winston, Bunyan), 7) **APM tools** (New Relic, DataDog), 8) **Memory profiling** (heapdump, clinic.js), 9) **Stack traces** - analyze error stacks, 10) **Breakpoints** in IDEs, 11) **async_hooks** for async context tracking.

---

### 33. Explain process.nextTick().
**Answer:** `process.nextTick()` schedules callback to execute immediately after current operation completes, before event loop continues. It has higher priority than setTimeout/setImmediate and Promise microtasks. Use cases: ensure asynchronous execution even in synchronous-looking code, emit events after object construction, break long operations into smaller chunks. Caution: recursive nextTick can starve I/O, blocking event loop. Example:
```javascript
console.log('start');
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
console.log('end');
// Output: start, end, nextTick
```

---

### 34. What is the global object in Node.js?
**Answer:** The global object provides variables/functions accessible everywhere without imports. Key globals: **global** (equivalent to window in browsers), **process** (info about Node.js process), **console** (logging), **Buffer** (binary data), **__dirname** (current directory), **__filename** (current file), **setTimeout/setInterval/setImmediate** (timers), **require()** (module loading), **module/exports** (module system). Unlike browsers, Node.js isolates variables declared with var/let/const to module scope, not global. Avoid polluting global scope in production code.

---

## 🧪 Testing in Node.js

### 35. What frameworks are available for testing Node.js applications?
**Answer:** Popular frameworks: **Jest** - zero config, built-in mocking, snapshot testing; **Mocha** - flexible, works with various assertion libraries; **Chai** - assertion library (BDD/TDD styles); **Jasmine** - behavior-driven testing; **AVA** - concurrent test execution; **Tap** - test anything protocol; **Supertest** - HTTP assertions; **Sinon** - spies, stubs, mocks; **Cypress** - end-to-end testing; **Puppeteer** - browser automation. Choose based on project needs: Jest for full-featured, Mocha for flexibility, AVA for speed.

---

### 36. Explain the concept of mocking in Node.js.
**Answer:** Mocking replaces real objects/functions with test doubles to isolate code under test. Types: **Mocks** (verify interactions), **Stubs** (replace functions with predetermined responses), **Spies** (record function calls). Used to: avoid external dependencies (databases, APIs), control test conditions, speed up tests, test error scenarios. Libraries: Sinon.js, Jest (built-in), testdouble.js. Example:
```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const stub = sinon.stub(database, 'query');
stub.returns(Promise.resolve(mockData));
// Test code using database.query
stub.restore();
```

---

### 37. Why is benchmarking important in Node.js?
**Answer:** Benchmarking measures performance to identify bottlenecks, compare implementation approaches, validate optimizations, ensure SLA compliance, and track performance over time. Important because: Node.js single-threaded nature makes performance critical, helps choose between sync/async approaches, identifies memory leaks, validates scalability. Tools: **benchmark.js** (micro-benchmarking), **autocannon** (HTTP load testing), **clinic.js** (performance profiling), **0x** (flamegraphs). Regular benchmarking prevents performance regressions during development.

---

### 38. How do you test an HTTP server in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app');

describe('GET /api/users', () => {
  it('should return users array', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users')
      .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
      .expect(200);
    
    expect(Array.isArray(response.body)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
Use Supertest with testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha). Test status codes, headers, response bodies, error handling. Mock database/external services. Test authentication, validation, edge cases. Integration tests for full request-response cycle.

---

## 💾 Node.js with Databases

### 39. How do you connect a MySQL database with Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql2');

// Create connection
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'mydb'
});

// Connect
connection.connect(err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Connected!');
});

// Query
connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (err, results) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(results);
});

// Use pool for multiple connections
const pool = mysql.createPool(config);
pool.query('SELECT * FROM users', callback);
```
Use mysql2 package (supports promises), connection pooling for performance, prepared statements for security, handle errors properly.

---

### 40. Explain how NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be used with Node.js.
**Answer:** MongoDB pairs naturally with Node.js (JSON-like documents match JavaScript objects). Use **mongoose** ODM or native **mongodb** driver:
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb');

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

// Create
await User.create({ name: 'John', email: 'john@email.com' });

// Find
const users = await User.find({ name: 'John' });
```
Benefits: flexible schema, horizontal scaling, rich query language, JSON documents, async operations fit Node.js model.

---

### 41. What's the role of ORM in Node.js?
**Answer:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) maps database tables to JavaScript objects, abstracting SQL. Popular ORMs: **Sequelize** (SQL databases), **TypeORM** (TypeScript-focused), **Prisma** (modern, type-safe), **Mongoose** (MongoDB ODM). Benefits: database-agnostic code, automatic query generation, migration management, validation, relationships handling, reduced boilerplate. Trade-offs: performance overhead, learning curve, complex queries may need raw SQL. Provides consistent API regardless of underlying database.

---

## 🚀 Node.js Performance

### 42. How can you monitor the performance of a Node.js app?
**Answer:** Tools and techniques: **APM tools** (New Relic, DataDog, AppDynamics) for production monitoring; **Node.js built-ins** (process.memoryUsage(), process.cpuUsage()); **Event loop monitoring** (loopbench, blocked-at); **Logging** (Winston, Pino); **Metrics** (prom-client for Prometheus); **Profiling** (clinic.js, 0x, node --prof); **Custom instrumentation** timing critical paths; **Health checks** endpoints; **Real User Monitoring** (RUM); **Error tracking** (Sentry, Rollbar). Monitor: response times, memory usage, CPU, error rates, throughput, event loop lag.

---

### 43. What is clustering in Node.js and how does it work?
**Answer:** Clustering spawns multiple Node.js processes (workers) to utilize multi-core CPUs. Master process manages workers, distributes incoming connections. Built-in cluster module:
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const os = require('os');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
  cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
    cluster.fork(); // Restart dead workers
  });
} else {
  // Worker code
  require('./app');
}
```
Benefits: utilize all CPU cores, fault tolerance (restart failed workers), zero-downtime restarts. Alternative: PM2 for production clustering.

---

### 44. How can you prevent memory leaks in a Node.js application?
**Answer:** Prevention strategies: 1) **Avoid global variables** - scope properly, 2) **Clear timers** - clearTimeout/clearInterval, 3) **Remove event listeners** - use once() or removeListener(), 4) **Close connections** - database, files, sockets, 5) **Limit cache size** - use LRU cache, 6) **Avoid closures** holding large objects, 7) **Stream large data** instead of buffering, 8) **Use WeakMap/WeakSet** for object references, 9) **Profile regularly** with heapdump/Chrome DevTools, 10) **Monitor memory** in production. Tools: node-memwatch, heapdump, clinic.js.

---

### 45. Explain the use of the --inspect flag in Node.js.
**Answer:** `--inspect` flag enables debugging protocol, allowing connection from Chrome DevTools or other debuggers. Usage: `node --inspect app.js` (default port 9229) or `node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229` for remote debugging. `--inspect-brk` starts with breakpoint on first line. Benefits: set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, profile CPU/memory, analyze heap snapshots, view console output. Connect via chrome://inspect in Chrome browser. Essential for debugging complex production issues without modifying code.

---

## ⚡ Concurrency in Node.js

### 46. How does Node.js handle concurrency?
**Answer:** Node.js handles concurrency through single-threaded, non-blocking, event-driven architecture with event loop. Instead of creating threads per request, uses asynchronous I/O operations delegated to system kernel or thread pool. Event loop manages callbacks from completed operations. Advantages: no thread management overhead, no race conditions, efficient memory usage. For CPU-intensive tasks: use worker threads, child processes, or clustering. Node.js excels at I/O concurrency but requires offloading CPU-bound work to maintain responsiveness.

---

### 47. What is the difference between the process and child_process modules?
**Answer:** **process** is global object providing info/control over current Node.js process: environment variables (process.env), arguments (process.argv), exit (process.exit()), signals (process.on('SIGTERM')), memory usage, CPU usage. **child_process** module creates new processes: spawn (stream I/O), exec (buffer output, shell), execFile (direct executable), fork (IPC channel for Node.js files). Use child_process to: run system commands, parallel processing, CPU-intensive tasks isolation, run untrusted code, utilize multiple cores.

---

### 48. How do worker threads work in Node.js?
**Answer:** Worker Threads enable true parallelism for CPU-intensive JavaScript operations. Unlike child processes, share memory via SharedArrayBuffer/transferable objects:
```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on('message', msg => console.log(msg));
  worker.postMessage('start');
} else {
  parentPort.on('message', msg => {
    // CPU-intensive work
    parentPort.postMessage('result');
  });
}
```
Use cases: image processing, encryption, data parsing, scientific computing. Lighter than child processes, share memory efficiently, avoid blocking event loop.

---

## 🧩 Node.js and Microservices

### 49. How is Node.js used in microservices architecture?
**Answer:** Node.js excels in microservices due to: lightweight runtime, fast startup, async nature for service-to-service communication, npm ecosystem for functionality, JSON-native for REST APIs, WebSocket support for real-time, easy containerization, horizontal scalability. Each microservice is independent Node.js application with specific responsibility. Benefits: independent deployment, technology flexibility, fault isolation, team autonomy. Use API gateways (Express Gateway, Kong), service mesh (Istio), message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), container orchestration (Kubernetes), service discovery (Consul).

---

### 50. Explain inter-process communication in a Node.js microservice architecture.
**Answer:** IPC methods: 1) **HTTP/REST** - synchronous, simple, stateless, 2) **Message Queues** (RabbitMQ, Kafka) - async, decoupled, reliable, 3) **gRPC** - efficient binary protocol, type-safe, 4) **WebSockets** - bidirectional, real-time, 5) **Redis Pub/Sub** - lightweight messaging, 6) **Event-driven** (EventBridge, SNS) - loosely coupled, 7) **Service Mesh** (Istio) - standardized communication layer. Choose based on: latency requirements, reliability needs, data volume, coupling tolerance. Implement circuit breakers, retries, timeouts for resilience.

## 🔒 Security in Node.js

### 51. What are some common security best practices for Node.js applications?
**Answer:** Best practices: 1) **Validate/sanitize input** - prevent injection attacks, 2) **Use parameterized queries** - prevent SQL injection, 3) **Helmet.js** - set security headers, 4) **Use HTTPS** - encrypt data in transit, 5) **Environment variables** - hide secrets, never hardcode, 6) **npm audit** - check dependencies for vulnerabilities, 7) **Rate limiting** - prevent brute force/DDoS, 8) **CORS** - control cross-origin access, 9) **Authentication/Authorization** - JWT, OAuth, session management, 10) **Regular updates** - keep Node.js and packages current, 11) **Principle of least privilege** - minimal permissions, 12) **Logging/monitoring** - detect suspicious activity.

---

### 52. How would you protect your Node.js application from XSS attacks?
**Answer:** XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) protection strategies: 1) **Sanitize output** - escape HTML characters using libraries like DOMPurify or xss, 2) **Content Security Policy** - helmet CSP headers restrict script sources, 3) **HttpOnly cookies** - prevent JavaScript access to session cookies, 4) **Validate input** - whitelist allowed characters/patterns, 5) **Template engines** - use auto-escaping (EJS, Pug with proper settings), 6) **Avoid innerHTML** - use textContent or safe DOM methods, 7) **X-XSS-Protection header** via Helmet, 8) **Context-aware encoding** - different escaping for HTML, JavaScript, CSS contexts. Never trust user input, always encode output.

---

### 53. What are environment variables and how could you use them in Node.js?
**Answer:** Environment variables store configuration outside code, varying by environment (dev/staging/production). Benefits: security (hide secrets), flexibility (change config without code changes), deployment ease. Access via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. Set using: 1) **Command line** - `PORT=3000 node app.js`, 2) **.env files** with dotenv package:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```
3) **Hosting platforms** - Heroku, AWS, Docker configs. Store: API keys, database URLs, ports, feature flags. Never commit .env to version control, use .env.example as template.

---

## 📡 Node.js and WebSockets

### 54. What are WebSockets and how do they work with Node.js?
**Answer:** WebSockets provide full-duplex, persistent communication channel over single TCP connection, enabling real-time bidirectional data flow between client and server. Unlike HTTP (request-response), WebSockets maintain open connection for continuous data exchange. Use cases: chat apps, live notifications, collaborative editing, gaming, live feeds. In Node.js, implement using ws library or Socket.IO (adds features like automatic reconnection, rooms, broadcasting). Handshake starts as HTTP, upgrades to WebSocket protocol. More efficient than polling for real-time updates, lower latency, reduced overhead.

---

### 55. How do you set up a WebSocket server in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
// Using ws library
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('Client connected');
  
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Received:', message);
    ws.send('Echo: ' + message);
  });
  
  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

// Using Socket.IO (more features)
const io = require('socket.io')(3000);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.emit('message', 'Welcome!');
  
  socket.on('chat', (data) => {
    io.emit('chat', data); // Broadcast to all
  });
});
```
Socket.IO adds auto-reconnection, rooms, namespaces, fallback mechanisms.

---

### 57. What is PM2 and how is it used in Node.js?
**Answer:** PM2 is production process manager for Node.js applications providing: clustering (utilize all CPUs), auto-restart on crashes, zero-downtime reloads, log management, monitoring dashboard, startup scripts, load balancing. Key commands:
```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max  # Start with cluster mode
pm2 restart app          # Restart application
pm2 reload app          # Zero-downtime reload
pm2 stop app            # Stop application
pm2 delete app          # Remove from PM2
pm2 logs                # View logs
pm2 monit              # Monitor dashboard
pm2 startup            # Generate startup script
pm2 save               # Save current process list
```
Essential for production, handles process lifecycle, improves availability and performance.

---

### 58. Explain how you would use Docker with a Node.js application.
**Answer:** 
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```
Best practices: 1) **Multi-stage builds** - separate build and runtime, 2) **Use .dockerignore** - exclude node_modules, logs, 3) **Alpine images** - smaller size, 4) **npm ci** - faster, reliable installs, 5) **Non-root user** - security, 6) **Layer caching** - COPY package.json before source, 7) **Health checks** - Docker HEALTHCHECK, 8) **docker-compose** for multi-container apps. Benefits: consistent environments, easy scaling, isolation, version control infrastructure.

---

## 🧭 Node.js and Version Control

### 59. How do you manage versioning of a Node.js API?
**Answer:** API versioning strategies: 1) **URL versioning** - `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users` (most common, clear), 2) **Header versioning** - `Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`, 3) **Query parameter** - `/api/users?version=1`, 4) **Subdomain** - `v1.api.example.com`. Implementation:
```javascript
// Express router approach
const v1Router = require('./routes/v1');
const v2Router = require('./routes/v2');
app.use('/api/v1', v1Router);
app.use('/api/v2', v2Router);
```
Best practices: maintain backward compatibility when possible, deprecation warnings, documentation for each version, version in package.json, semantic versioning for changes.

---

### 60. What are semantic versioning (semver) and its importance in Node.js development?
**Answer:** Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., 2.4.1): **MAJOR** - breaking changes (incompatible API), **MINOR** - new features (backward compatible), **PATCH** - bug fixes (backward compatible). Symbols: `^1.2.3` (compatible with 1.x.x, allows minor/patch), `~1.2.3` (allows patch only), `1.2.3` (exact version), `*` (latest). Importance: predictable dependency management, communicate change impact, safe updates, avoid breaking changes, npm/yarn use for dependency resolution. Pre-release: `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta.1`. Helps teams understand update risks, maintain compatibility.

---

## ⚙️ Node.js Advanced Topics

### 61. What is the difference between exports and module.exports in Node.js?
**Answer:** `module.exports` is the actual exported object; `exports` is shorthand reference to `module.exports`. Initially `exports === module.exports`. Key difference:
```javascript
// Works - adds property
exports.foo = 'bar';

// Breaks - reassigns exports, loses reference
exports = { foo: 'bar' }; // Won't work!

// Works - reassigns what's exported
module.exports = { foo: 'bar' };

// Final export is always module.exports
```
Rule: use `exports.prop` to add properties, use `module.exports` to replace entire export. When in doubt, use `module.exports`. Understanding prevents common module export bugs.

---

### 62. How can you create a simple TCP server in Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  console.log('Client connected');
  
  socket.write('Welcome to TCP server\n');
  
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('Received:', data.toString());
    socket.write('Echo: ' + data);
  });
  
  socket.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
  
  socket.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Socket error:', err);
  });
});

server.listen(8124, () => {
  console.log('TCP server listening on port 8124');
});
```
TCP provides lower-level networking than HTTP, used for custom protocols, streaming data, persistent connections.

---

### 63. What is REPL in Node.js?
**Answer:** REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) is interactive shell for executing JavaScript. Start with `node` command without file. Features: **Read** - input code, **Eval** - execute code, **Print** - output result, **Loop** - repeat. Commands: `.help` (show commands), `.break` (exit multi-line), `.clear` (reset context), `.save` (save session), `.load` (load file), `.editor` (multi-line mode), underscore `_` (last result). Uses: quick testing, debugging, learning JavaScript, prototyping. Can be used programmatically with `repl.start()` for custom interactive shells.

---

### 64. Explain the role of a reverse proxy with Node.js applications.
**Answer:** Reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, HAProxy) sits between clients and Node.js servers, forwarding requests. Benefits: 1) **Load balancing** - distribute traffic across multiple Node instances, 2) **SSL/TLS termination** - handle HTTPS, offload encryption, 3) **Caching** - serve static content, cache responses, 4) **Compression** - gzip responses, 5) **Security** - hide server details, DDoS protection, rate limiting, 6) **Static files** - serve efficiently without Node.js, 7) **Multiple apps** - route to different backends based on path/domain, 8) **WebSocket support** - handle upgrades. Node.js handles application logic; proxy handles infrastructure concerns.

---

### 65. How do Node.js streams enhance performance?
**Answer:** Streams process data in chunks rather than loading entirely into memory. Performance benefits: 1) **Memory efficiency** - handle large files without exhausting RAM, 2) **Time efficiency** - start processing before all data arrives (piping), 3) **Composability** - chain operations (read → transform → write), 4) **Backpressure** - automatic flow control prevents memory overflow. Example: streaming 1GB file uses ~25KB memory vs 1GB for readFile. Types enable different patterns: readable (read), writable (write), duplex (both), transform (modify). Essential for file processing, HTTP requests/responses, real-time data, video streaming.

---

## 🧱 Frameworks and Libraries in Node.js

### 66. Describe some popular frameworks and libraries in the Node.js ecosystem.

**Answer:** 
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// GET request
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` },
      params: { limit: 10 }
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API Error:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

// POST request
async function postData(payload) {
  return await axios.post('https://api.example.com/data', payload);
}
```
Best practices: use environment variables for keys, implement retry logic, handle rate limits, validate responses, use timeout, cache when appropriate, implement circuit breaker pattern, log API calls, handle errors gracefully.

---

### 71. What is Socket.IO and how does it work with Node.js?
**Answer:** Socket.IO is library for real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication. Built on WebSockets with fallbacks (polling). Features: **Automatic reconnection**, **Rooms/Namespaces** - organize connections, **Broadcasting** - message multiple clients, **Binary support**, **Multiplexing** - multiple channels over one connection.
```javascript
// Server
const io = require('socket.io')(3000);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.join('room1');
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    io.to('room1').emit('message', data); // Broadcast to room
  });
});

// Client
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
socket.emit('message', 'Hello');
socket.on('message', (data) => console.log(data));
```
Use cases: chat, gaming, collaboration tools, live dashboards, notifications.

---

### 72. Explain how GraphQL can be used with Node.js.
**Answer:** GraphQL is query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly what they need. Implement with Apollo Server or express-graphql:
```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// Schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type User { id: ID!, name: String!, email: String! }
  type Query { user(id: ID!): User, users: [User] }
  type Mutation { createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User }
`;

// Resolvers
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (_, { id }) => getUserById(id),
    users: () => getAllUsers()
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: (_, { name, email }) => createNewUser(name, email)
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
```
Benefits: no over/under-fetching, single endpoint, strong typing, introspection, real-time with subscriptions.

---

## 💻 Node.js with Frontend Technologies

### 73. How does Node.js interact with frontend frameworks like Angular or React?
**Answer:** Node.js serves as backend for frontend frameworks: 1) **Development server** - webpack-dev-server, Vite run on Node, 2) **Build tools** - compile, bundle, optimize (webpack, Rollup), 3) **API server** - provide REST/GraphQL APIs, 4) **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Next.js, Nuxt.js render React/Vue on server, 5) **Static site generation** - Gatsby, Next.js, 6) **Package management** - npm/yarn install dependencies, 7) **Testing** - Jest, Cypress run on Node, 8) **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** - Node.js layer aggregating APIs. Communication: HTTP requests (Axios, Fetch), WebSocket, GraphQL. Deployment: separate or monorepo with frontend.

---

### 74. What is server-side rendering and how can it be achieved with Node.js?
**Answer:** SSR renders React/Vue components on server, sending HTML to client (vs client-side rendering). Benefits: **SEO** - crawlers see content, **Performance** - faster initial load, **Social sharing** - preview metadata. Implement with:
```javascript
// Next.js (React)
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return { props: { data } };
}

// Express + React
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
  res.send(`<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><div id="root">${html}</div></body></html>`);
});
```
Frameworks: Next.js (React), Nuxt.js (Vue), Angular Universal. Challenges: state management, caching, increased server load. Hybrid: SSR first load, CSR navigation.

npx eslint --init
```
```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "env": { "node": true, "es2021": true },
  "rules": { "no-console": "warn", "semi": ["error", "always"] }
}
```
Integrate: 1) **IDE** - real-time feedback, 2) **Git hooks** - Husky pre-commit, 3) **CI/CD** - fail build on errors, 4) **Pre-push** - prevent bad code. Pair with Prettier for formatting. Benefits: consistent style, catch errors early, enforce best practices.

---

## 📈 Scaling Node.js Applications

### 78. What are some strategies for scaling Node.js applications?
**Answer:** Scaling strategies: **Vertical** (scale up - more CPU/RAM) vs **Horizontal** (scale out - more instances). Horizontal approaches: 1) **Clustering** - multiple Node processes on one machine, 2) **Load balancing** - Nginx, HAProxy distribute requests, 3) **Microservices** - split into smaller services, 4) **Containerization** - Docker + Kubernetes orchestration, 5) **Serverless** - AWS Lambda, scale automatically, 6) **Caching** - Redis for session/data, 7) **Database** - read replicas, sharding, connection pooling, 8) **CDN** - static assets, 9) **Message queues** - decouple services, 10) **Stateless design** - enable easy horizontal scaling. Monitor: response times, CPU, memory, error rates.

---

### 79. How do you handle session management in a scaled Node.js application?
**Answer:** In scaled environments, avoid in-memory sessions (not shared across instances). Solutions: 1) **Redis/Memcached** - external session store, fast access:
```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(session);
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

app.use(session({
  store: new RedisStore({ client }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));
```
2) **JWT tokens** - stateless, self-contained, 3) **Database** - PostgreSQL, MongoDB for persistence, 4) **Sticky sessions** - route user to same server (not ideal). Redis recommended: fast, supports TTL, shared across instances, handles failover.

---

### 80. How does the use of microservices affect the scalability of a Node.js application?
**Answer:** Microservices enhance scalability: 1) **Independent scaling** - scale only bottleneck services, 2) **Resource optimization** - allocate resources per service needs, 3) **Fault isolation** - failures don't cascade, 4) **Technology flexibility** - different tools per service, 5) **Parallel development** - teams work independently, 6) **Faster deployments** - update individual services. Challenges: 1) **Complexity** - service discovery, orchestration, 2) **Network overhead** - inter-service communication, 3) **Data consistency** - distributed transactions, 4) **Monitoring** - more moving parts, 5) **Testing** - integration complexity. Node.js strengths: lightweight, fast startup, async I/O ideal for microservices communication.

---

## 🔬 Node.js and Message Queues

### 81. What are message queues and how are they used in Node.js?
**Answer:** Message queues enable asynchronous communication between services/processes. Producer sends messages to queue; consumer processes them. Benefits: **Decoupling** - services independent, **Reliability** - persist messages, retry failures, **Scalability** - multiple consumers process parallel, **Load leveling** - handle traffic spikes, **Async processing** - offload heavy tasks. Popular queues: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS, Redis Pub/Sub, Bull (Redis-based). Use cases: email sending, image processing, order processing, event-driven architecture, microservices communication. Pattern: producer → queue → consumer(s).

---

### 82. How do you implement RabbitMQ with Node.js?
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const amqp = require('amqplib');

// Producer
async function sendMessage() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();
  const queue = 'task_queue';
  
  await channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true });
  channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from('Task data'), {
    persistent: true
  });
  console.log('Message sent');
  
  setTimeout(() => connection.close(), 500);
}

// Consumer
async function receiveMessage() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();
  
  await channel.assertQueue('task_queue', { durable: true });
  channel.prefetch(1); // Process one at a time
  
  channel.consume('task_queue', (msg) => {
    console.log('Received:', msg.content.toString());
    // Process task
    channel.ack(msg); // Acknowledge
  });
}
```
Features: durable queues, message acknowledgments, prefetch, exchanges (fanout, direct, topic).

---

### 83. What is the significance of ZeroMQ in Node.js applications?
**Answer:** ZeroMQ is high-performance async messaging library for building distributed systems. Unlike RabbitMQ (broker-based), ZeroMQ is brokerless, peer-to-peer. Patterns: **REQ-REP** (request-reply), **PUB-SUB** (publish-subscribe), **PUSH-PULL** (pipeline), **PAIR** (exclusive pair). Benefits: **Fast** - low latency, high throughput, **Simple** - easy API, **Flexible** - various transports (TCP, IPC, inproc), **Lightweight** - no broker overhead. Use Node.js with zeromq package. Use cases: real-time systems, high-frequency trading, distributed computing, IoT. Trade-offs: no message persistence (unlike RabbitMQ), manual retry logic, simpler but requires more implementation.

---

## ☁️ Node.js and Cloud Services

### 84. How do cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP facilitate Node.js application deployment?

Benefits: auto-scaling, managed services, global reach, pay-per-use, high availability.

---

### 85. What is serverless architecture, and how does it relate to Node.js?
**Answer:** Serverless means no server management; cloud provider handles infrastructure. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS): AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions. Characteristics: **Event-driven** - triggered by events, **Auto-scaling** - automatic, **Pay-per-execution** - no idle costs, **Stateless** - ephemeral. Node.js ideal for serverless: fast cold starts, async nature, small footprint. Use cases: APIs, webhooks, data processing, scheduled tasks, real-time file processing.
```javascript
// AWS Lambda handler
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const body = JSON.parse(event.body);
  // Process
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Success' })
  };
};
```
Limitations: execution time limits, cold starts, vendor lock-in, debugging challenges.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Management

### 86. How can you manage multiple Node.js versions on the same machine?
**Answer:** Version managers: **nvm** (Node Version Manager - most popular):
```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Usage
nvm install 18        # Install Node 18
nvm install 20        # Install Node 20
nvm use 18           # Switch to Node 18
nvm alias default 18 # Set default
nvm list             # List installed versions
```
Alternatives: **n** (simpler, requires sudo), **fnm** (fast), **nvs** (Windows-friendly). Benefits: test across versions, project-specific versions (.nvmrc file), easy switching. Use .nvmrc in project root to specify version.

### 87. What are .env files and how do they work in a Node.js application?
**Answer:** .env files store environment variables in key=value format, keeping secrets out of code. Use dotenv package:
```bash
# .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/mydb
API_KEY=secret_key_123
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```
```javascript
// app.js
require('dotenv').config();

const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```
Best practices: **Never commit .env** - add to .gitignore, create .env.example template, different .env per environment (.env.development, .env.production), validate required variables at startup, use for secrets/config only. Load early in application startup before accessing process.env.

---

### 88. Describe the usage of the config module in Node.js.
**Answer:** The config module manages hierarchical configurations for different deployment environments. Features: environment-specific configs, default configs with overrides, file formats (JSON, YAML, JS), environment variable support.
```javascript
// config/default.json
{ "server": { "port": 3000 }, "db": { "host": "localhost" } }

// config/production.json
{ "db": { "host": "prod-db.example.com" } }

// Usage
const config = require('config');
const port = config.get('server.port');
const dbHost = config.get('db.host');
```
Structure: config/default.json (base), config/development.json, config/production.json. Override order: default < environment < environment variables < command line. Benefits: organized configuration, environment management, type checking, documentation through schema validation.

### 92. Describe how to handle file uploads in a Node.js application.
**Answer:** 
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

// Configure storage
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: './uploads/',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// File filter
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  const allowedTypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|pdf/;
  const extname = allowedTypes.test(path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase());
  const mimetype = allowedTypes.test(file.mimetype);
  
  if (extname && mimetype) {
    return cb(null, true);
  }
  cb(new Error('Invalid file type'));
};

const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 5MB
  fileFilter: fileFilter
});

// Single file
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.json({ file: req.file });
});

// Multiple files
app.post('/uploads', upload.array('files', 5), (req, res) => {
  res.json({ files: req.files });
});
```
Best practices: validate file type/size, sanitize filenames, use cloud storage (S3) for production, scan for viruses, generate unique filenames, implement rate limiting, handle errors, use streams for large files.

---

### 93. How would you handle heavy computation tasks in a Node.js application?
**Answer:** Strategies: 1) **Worker Threads** - CPU-intensive JavaScript in separate threads:
```javascript
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

function runWorker(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: data });
    worker.on('message', resolve);
    worker.on('error', reject);
  });
}
```
2) **Child Processes** - spawn separate processes, 3) **Clustering** - distribute across CPU cores, 4) **Message Queues** - offload to background workers (Bull, RabbitMQ), 5) **Microservices** - separate compute service in Python/Go, 6) **Serverless functions** - AWS Lambda for burst computation, 7) **Caching** - memoize expensive results, 8) **Break into chunks** - use setImmediate for yielding event loop.
