# 🟢 SQL Interview Q&A

## 🧩 Basic Level

### ❓ What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is designed for **inserting**, **querying**, **updating**, and **managing** data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

---

### ❓ What are the differences between DDL, DML, and DCL in SQL?

| Type    | Full Form                  | Purpose                                                                                        | Example Queries                             |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **DDL** | Data Definition Language   | Defines or changes the structure of database objects (like tables, schemas).                   | `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` |
| **DML** | Data Manipulation Language | Deals with actual data inside tables — inserting, updating, deleting, and **retrieving** data. | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`      |
| **DCL** | Data Control Language      | Controls access and permissions to the database.                                               | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                           |

### 🧱 DDL Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT
);
```

### 🧩 DML Example
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Nikhil', 22);
```

### 🔐 DCL Example
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Students TO user1;
```
> This gives permission to `user1` to read (SELECT) data from the table **Students**.

---

### ❓ What is a Transaction in SQL?
A **transaction** in SQL is a sequence of operations performed as a single unit of work.  
It ensures that either **all operations succeed (COMMIT)** or **none of them take effect (ROLLBACK)**, maintaining data integrity.

---

### ❓ What is a Database Lock?
A **Database Lock** is like a “DO NOT DISTURB” sign placed on data by a transaction to prevent others from modifying it simultaneously.

**Purpose:** To maintain data integrity by avoiding conflicts between multiple users.

---

### ❓ What are the Types of Locks?

## 🔒 Types of Locks in SQL

---

### **1. Shared Lock (S Lock)**

**Purpose:**  
Allows transactions to **read** a resource (like a row or table) but **not modify** it.  
Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same data **at the same time**.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Shared Lock (S)
-- Still open...

-- Transaction T2
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Also Shared Lock (S)
```
✅ Both T1 and T2 can read concurrently.  
❌ If T3 tries to UPDATE the same record, it must wait until T1 and T2 release their shared locks.

---

### **2. Exclusive Lock (X Lock)**

**Purpose:**  
Allows a transaction to **read and modify** data.  
No other transaction can **read or write** the same data while this lock is held.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 1000 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Exclusive Lock (X)
-- T1 still open...

-- Transaction T2
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Will WAIT (blocked)
```
✅ Only T1 can read/write during the lock.  
❌ T2 must wait until T1 commits or rolls back.

---

### **3. Update Lock (U Lock)**

**Purpose:**  
An **Update Lock** is a **temporary, in-between** lock between Shared (S) and Exclusive (X).  
It’s used when a transaction **reads data with the intention to update it later**.  
The main reason: **to prevent deadlocks** that occur when two transactions try to upgrade from S → X at the same time.

**Without Update Locks (Deadlock-prone):**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRAN;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Shared Lock (S)
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Transaction T2
BEGIN TRAN;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Shared Lock (S)
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 200 WHERE AccountID = 1;
```
Both T1 and T2 read successfully (S locks).  
When both reach `UPDATE`, each tries to upgrade S → X and ends up **waiting for each other → DEADLOCK** ❌

**With Update Locks (No Deadlock):**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRAN;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WITH (UPDLOCK) WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Update Lock (U)
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Converts U → X

-- Transaction T2
BEGIN TRAN;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WITH (UPDLOCK) WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Must WAIT
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 200 WHERE AccountID = 1;
```
✅ Only one transaction can hold a U lock at a time.  
✅ When it updates, the U lock upgrades to an X lock.  
✅ Prevents deadlocks safely.

---

### **4. Intent Locks (IS, IX, SIX, etc.)**

we can use Shared, Exclusive, and Update locks directly in my code. For Intent Locks, while they're automatically managed by SQL Server.

**Purpose:**  
Intent Locks **don’t lock data directly**, they **signal the intention** to acquire locks at a lower level (like rows or pages).  
They help the database engine **detect conflicts quickly** when both row-level and table-level locks exist.

**Types:**
| Lock | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **IS (Intent Shared)** | Intention to acquire shared locks at lower level |
| **IX (Intent Exclusive)** | Intention to acquire exclusive locks at lower level |
| **SIX (Shared + Intent Exclusive)** | Shared lock on table + intention to get exclusive locks on some rows |

Scenario 1: Compatible Intentions - Both Can Proceed

-- Transaction A (Reading)
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Dept = 'IT';
-- Places: Intent Shared (IS) on table + Shared (S) on IT rows
```

-- Transaction B (Reading different rows)  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Dept = 'HR';
-- Places: Intent Shared (IS) on table + Shared (S) on HR rows
-- ✅ RESULT: Both succeed! IS locks are compatible.
```

Scenario 2: Reading vs Writing - Reader Waits
```sql
-- Transaction A (Writing)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 50000 WHERE ID = 100;
-- Places: Intent Exclusive (IX) on table + Exclusive (X) on row 100
```

-- Transaction B (Trying to read the same row)
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE ID = 100;
-- Tries: Intent Shared (IS) on table + Shared (S) on row 100
-- ❌ RESULT: Transaction B WAITS because IX and S are incompatible
```

Scenario 3: Writing vs Writing - Second Writer Waits
```sql
-- Transaction A 
UPDATE Products SET Stock = Stock - 1 WHERE ProductID = 5;
-- Places: IX on table + X on ProductID 5
```

-- Transaction B
```sql
UPDATE Products SET Price = 19.99 WHERE ProductID = 5;  
-- Tries: IX on table + X on ProductID 5
-- ❌ RESULT: Transaction B WAITS because X and X are incompatible
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRAN;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;  -- Shared Lock (S) on row
-- Adds Intent Shared (IS) on table

-- Transaction T2
BEGIN TRAN;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;  -- Exclusive Lock (X) on row
-- Adds Intent Exclusive (IX) on table
```
✅ Intent locks prevent conflicts between table-level and row-level operations efficiently.

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Lock Type | Allows Read | Allows Write | Other Reads Allowed | Purpose |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Shared (S)** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Reading data |
| **Exclusive (X)** | ✅ (by owner) | ✅ | ❌ | Updating/deleting data |
| **Update (U)** | ✅ | ❌ (until converted) | ❌ | Prevents deadlocks during updates |
| **Intent (IS/IX)** | — | — | — | Indicates intention to lock lower-level objects |


---

### ❓ What is a Primary Key?
A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record in a table. It cannot contain NULL values.

---

### ❓ What is a Composite Key?
A **Composite Key** is made up of **two or more columns** used together to uniquely identify a record.

---

### ❓ What is a Foreign Key?
A **Foreign Key** is a column that creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the Primary Key of another table.

---

### ❓ Difference between HAVING and WHERE Clause

| Clause | Used With | Filters On | Example |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| **WHERE** | Rows | Individual rows | `SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age > 18;` |
| **HAVING** | Groups | Aggregate results | `SELECT age, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY age HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;` |

---

### ❓ What is an Identity Column?
An **Identity Column** automatically generates unique numeric values (often for primary keys).

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INT IDENTITY(1,1),
  name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### ❓ What is a View in SQL and How to Create One?

A View in SQL is like a virtual table — it doesn’t store data itself but displays data stored in one or more underlying tables.

You can think of it as a saved SQL query

```sql
CREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```
apply query on view
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_it_salary
FROM IT_Employees;
```
---

### ❓ Uses of a View
- Simplifies complex queries  
- Restricts access to specific columns  
- Provides logical data independence

---

### ❓ What is a Join?
A **Join** combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

---

### ❓ Types of Joins
- **INNER JOIN**
- **LEFT JOIN**
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**
- **CROSS JOIN**
- **SELF JOIN**

---

### ❓ What is Normalization?
**Normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

---

### ❓ What is De-normalization?
**De-normalization** adds redundancy to improve query performance by combining related tables.

---

### ❓ What is a Clustered and Non-Clustered Index?
- **Clustered Index:** Rearranges the actual data in the table. (One per table)  
- **Non-Clustered Index:** Creates a separate structure that points to the data.

---

### ❓ What are Constraints?
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns — such as **NOT NULL**, **UNIQUE**, **CHECK**, **DEFAULT**, **PRIMARY KEY**, and **FOREIGN KEY**.

---

### ❓ Define Referential Integrity
It ensures relationships between tables remain consistent — a foreign key value must always refer to an existing primary key.

---

### ❓ What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?
An **ERD** visually represents tables (entities), their attributes, and the relationships between them.

---

### ❓ What is an Alternate Key?
An **Alternate Key** is any candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key.
