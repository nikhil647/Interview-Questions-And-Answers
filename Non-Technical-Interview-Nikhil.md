eg.
Hello, my name is Nikhil Patil. I have completed my Engineering in Computer Science and have also earned certifications in JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Firebase.
I have 6+ years of experience as a MERN Stack Developer, with strong expertise in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Currently, I am working at ZORO UK as a MERN Stack Developer, where I contribute to building and maintaining a scalable B2B e-commerce platform with features like complex product catalogues, user authentication, and third-party integrations.
Previously, I have worked on projects such as a school management system at NeoSOFT and a hotel and travel booking platform at Vernost, which gave me hands-on experience in developing responsive web applications, RESTful APIs, and scalable front-end solutions.
Apart from my MERN expertise, I am also comfortable working with Redux, Tailwind, Jest, Git, and AWS serverless. I’m passionate about delivering high-quality solutions, learning new technologies, and collaborating with teams to build impactful products.

```

**What drives you in your career?**
```
What really drives me is the idea that a few lines of code can have such a big impact on people’s lives.
I love the fact that something I build can make someone’s work easier, save their time, or even improve their daily experience.
That feeling of seeing a project go from just an idea to something real that people actually use—that’s what keeps me motivated.
```

**Tasks which you did zoro just for reference in future**

```

**How do you deal with pressure at the work place?**
```
I don’t get affected by pressure much. I stay calm and focused. In fact, I work well under pressure. If it gets too much, I take short breaks to unwind. That’s how I deal with pressure.
```

**How do you handle criticism/negative feedback?**
```
I believe that negative feedback is an important part of the learning and growth process. Whenever I get the negative feedback,
I acknowledge and accept it and try to improve upon these areas. That's how I handle negative feedback.
```
**How do you manage a situation where your co-workers are not working and its affecting your task & overall delivery of the project/sprint?**
```
First of all, I connect with them to understand the reason. If they are stuck or if they are struggling with something, I try and help them. If still they don't work, then I raise this issue to my team lead. I request them to intervene and help resolve the situation. That's how I handle such a situation.
```

***How do you ensure code quality and avoid breaking existing features?***
```
Clean, Readable Code – I stick to coding standards, proper naming conventions, and modular design so that the code is easy to understand and maintain.
Code Reviews & Collaboration – I believe peer reviews are one of the best ways to maintain quality. They not only catch bugs early but also help in knowledge sharing.
Testing – I write unit tests and, where needed, integration tests using tools like Jest or similar frameworks.

And some company use cypress to make sure devs dont break the exhsiting working feature. I have working expreiance of it
```

**How do you measure your success (top 3 career metrics)?**
```
career metrics may differ for each individual.
1. Technical Proficiency and Skill Growth: Continuous improvement in technical skills and proficiency is a key measure of success for a software engineer.
2. Project Impact and Delivery: I often measure my success by the impact I make on projects. Some examples like 
Meeting project deadlines and delivering high-quality software on time.
Reducing the number of bugs or issues in software.
3 Career Growth and Advancement: 
This includes Promotions to more senior roles, such as senior software engineer, lead developer.
```
***How do you keep yourself updated with the latest technology stack?***
```
First I read technical blogs related to the tech stack I am working to get an idea which new technology is needed for me to upgrade my skills and then I take advantage of online learning platforms such as Coursera, and Udemy to enroll in courses and tutorials that cover the latest technologies.
