eg.
Hello, my name is Nikhil Patil. I have completed my Engineering in Computer Science and have also earned certifications in JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Firebase.
I have 6+ years of experience as a MERN Stack Developer, with strong expertise in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Currently, I am working at ZORO UK as a MERN Stack Developer, where I contribute to building and maintaining a scalable B2B e-commerce platform with features like complex product catalogues, user authentication, and third-party integrations.
Previously, I have worked on projects such as a school management system at NeoSOFT and a hotel and travel booking platform at Vernost, which gave me hands-on experience in developing responsive web applications, RESTful APIs, and scalable front-end solutions.
Apart from my MERN expertise, I am also comfortable working with Redux, Tailwind, Jest, Git, and AWS serverless. I’m passionate about delivering high-quality solutions, learning new technologies, and collaborating with teams to build impactful products. 


**Could you please describe some of your recent projects?**
```

ATS Resume Builder - uses open AI to rate resume based on job description and create new CV.  or may be some another idea.
```

**What drives you in your career?**
```
What really drives me is the idea that a few lines of code can have such a big impact on people’s lives.
I love the fact that something I build can make someone’s work easier, save their time, or even improve their daily experience.
That feeling of seeing a project go from just an idea to something real that people actually use—that’s what keeps me motivated.
```

**Tasks which you did zoro just for reference in future**
```
Migrating Page from old repo (redux saga) to new repo (react-query (microfronntend) + hooks).

scenario when we get new supplier or old supplier has setup to automate.
1) Once customer places an Order, we send PO (Purchase Order) to customer see we got this order for you. via API which supplier provide.

```

**How do you deal with pressure at the work place?**
```
I don’t get affected by pressure much. I stay calm and focused. In fact, I work well under pressure. If it gets too much, I take short breaks to unwind. That’s how I deal with pressure.
```

**How do you handle criticism/negative feedback?**
```
I believe that negative feedback is an important part of the learning and growth process. Whenever I get the negative feedback,
I acknowledge and accept it and try to improve upon these areas. That's how I handle negative feedback.
```
**How do you manage a situation where your co-workers are not working and its affecting your task & overall delivery of the project/sprint?**
```
First of all, I connect with them to understand the reason. If they are stuck or if they are struggling with something, I try and help them. If still they don't work, then I raise this issue to my team lead. I request them to intervene and help resolve the situation. That's how I handle such a situation.
```

***How do you ensure code quality and avoid breaking existing features?***
```
Clean, Readable Code – I stick to coding standards, proper naming conventions, and modular design so that the code is easy to understand and maintain.
Code Reviews & Collaboration – I believe peer reviews are one of the best ways to maintain quality. They not only catch bugs early but also help in knowledge sharing.
Testing – I write unit tests and, where needed, integration tests using tools like Jest or similar frameworks.

And some company use cypress to make sure devs dont break the exhsiting working feature. I have working expreiance of it
```

**How do you measure your success (top 3 career metrics)?**
```
career metrics may differ for each individual.
1. Technical Proficiency and Skill Growth: Continuous improvement in technical skills and proficiency is a key measure of success for a software engineer.
2. Project Impact and Delivery: I often measure my success by the impact I make on projects. Some examples like 
Meeting project deadlines and delivering high-quality software on time.
Reducing the number of bugs or issues in software.
3 Career Growth and Advancement: 
This includes Promotions to more senior roles, such as senior software engineer, lead developer.
```
***How do you keep yourself updated with the latest technology stack?***
```
First I read technical blogs related to the tech stack I am working to get an idea which new technology is needed for me to upgrade my skills and then I take advantage of online learning platforms such as Coursera, and Udemy to enroll in courses and tutorials that cover the latest technologies.
